Book Recommendation System
==============================

This is a book recommendation system using the [goodreads-100K dataset](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k) and a collaborative filtering algorithm. On entering a book you liked, the algorithm recommends other books you might be interested in

The project contains a jupyter notebook which includes EDA and other processing. It has also been converted into a Flask webapp

To run the app, run 'train.py' first to compute the recommendations and then run app.py to start the webapp
